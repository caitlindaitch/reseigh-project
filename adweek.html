				<p id="project-copy">Having something more than a print ad at AdWeek was something new for Neustar. The company wanted to be seen, but that is difficult to do on a budget and competing with top global brands.

				</p>

				<p id="project-copy">The solution was to take out an ad, get a booth space, secure a speaking slot and do it in a way that was not typical for Neustar. The theme "Identity Matters" was chosen due to identity always being the elephant in the room that everyone was afraid to talk about due to big data privacy. Visuals followed suit and when it came time to add something to get people talking, the custom social media vending machine was created. Visitors chose their identity and posted it online to have the machine drop a prize. This got people talking about the company and how identity matters in marketing. The identities used for the machine were also tied into the CMO's presentation using real data from Neustar to tie everything together.
